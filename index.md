Here is **Shengzhou Wen ( [温胜宙](https://caihanlin.com/file/蔡汉霖简历.pdf))**.

I‘ve graduated from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University with a bachelor's degree in clinical science in 2021. I'm a PhD candidate right now, mainly focusing on stem intestinal cell and Hippo pathway. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://dqxy.fzu.edu.cn/info/1102/3547.htm) and [Dr. Chin Hong Wong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chin-Hong-Wong). Here is [my Resume](https://caihanlin.com/file/Resume-HanlinCAI.pdf).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on several interesting cases I've been dealing with during my rotations. My interests are on the **Internal Medicine** and differential diagnosis. In my opinion, they show the beauty of logic and positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
