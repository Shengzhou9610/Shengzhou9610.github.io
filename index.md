I‘ve graduated from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University with a bachelor's degree in clinical science in 2021.

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on several interesting cases I've been dealing with during my rotations. My interests are on the **Internal Medicine** and differential diagnosis. In my opinion, they show the beauty of logic and positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
