## Thesis

- [Functions and regulations of the Hippo signaling pathway intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis](https://shengzhou9610.github.io/mypaper/thesis/Hippo Pathway.pdf)<br>**Shengzhou Wen** (Advisor: Prof. Faxing Yu)<br>Research about hippo signaling by intestinal organoid<br>**Abstract:** *The intestine is an important digestive organ. Intestinal diseases such as acute or chronic enteritis*
  *and colorectal cancer pose a great threat to human health, which endows the studies related to intestine with great*
  *scientific and clinical value. The Hippo signaling pathway plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation*
  *of intestinal stem cells, and is involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes in the intestine. In this*
  *review, we summarize known functions and mechanisms of the Hippo signaling pathway in intestinal regeneration*
  *and tumorigenesis, provide a prospective on future research directions, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies*
  *targeting the Hippo signaling pathway.*
